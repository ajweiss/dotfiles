# this is my dotfile song, it is not very long, hey!

There's not much in here that is too exciting, I like things that are fast, minimal and reliable.

* vim-plug to manage plugins
    * vim-slime (with my patch) for notebook-free cell based interactive python
    * minibufexpl and tagbar for vim to give an 'ide-like' feel
* mouse mode for tmux and vim
* vi like keys for tmux cut/paste

## TODO

* write an install script
* figure out a completion situation for vim that doesn't annoy
* steal some fancy configs from others
